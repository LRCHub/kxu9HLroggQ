How do you feel being controlled?
Don't you wanna break free?
How would you feel if there were no rules?
What would you do? Tell me.

I don't have the pride, I don't have the money.
But I've got these hands.
I'm feelin' alive, I'm making a change.
With my own hands.

Come with me now, follow me, trust me
Time's passing by, can't afford hesitation.

Oh have no fear, we've past our tears,
Yeah we can make it
What's left to do, let's make our move
Yeah here we go now

Run run far away, run run to a better place
Somewhere we can laugh truthfully

Run run far away, they're not gonna find us today
Maybe they can try another day
Give yourself a hug, no one's gonna take it away
Nothing's wrong with making it your own way

Come with me now, follow me, trust me
Time's passing by, can't afford to hesitate

Oh beautiful sky, brighten with glee, smiling on me
Oh beautiful world shining and free, it's all for me

I don't have the pride, I don't have the money,
But I've got these hands
I'm feeling alive, with you right beside me
Come on ahead

Run run far away, run run to a better place
Somewhere we can laugh truthfully
Run run far away, they're not gonna find us today
Maybe they can try another day
Give yourself a hug, no one's gonna take it away
Nothing's wrong with making it your own way

Run run far away, run run to a better place
Somewhere we can laugh truthfully
Run run far away, they're not gonna find us today
Maybe they can try another day

Dear friends come with me, this time we can make it right
Let's be on tonight start over again
