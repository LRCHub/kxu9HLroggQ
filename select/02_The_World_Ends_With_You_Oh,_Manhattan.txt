For a man of many faces, you look familiar
Prophetic voices in my head are telling me to
Run like hell

Where have you been? I still see you
In the face of our children (the face of our children)
I heard you made it through the static
We hold these blessings by a string
But these prayers are meaningless
Because we both know, we both know where we're going

Stand behind your pride, counting the days til the summer
When we are born again
Put on your tattered clothes, and proceed to walk
That lonely road, of pale white tired lines

And I still can't carry the weight of the world
Take it off my back, take it off my back
The world it ends with you The world well it ends, the world well it ends with you

We are mirror images of false pretenses
Surrounded by malice and dissolution
Well, Mother lay concrete is proof
The marks I've made and the struggles I'll lose
What's yours tattooed? C'est la vie, your body shattered

Well give me a reason to live
Cause there's nothing left to live for
We might as well put on our wooden coats and wait
For the chariot to take us away to a better place
Where we can be at peace, I'll be at peace

An exodus is not an option,
Everyone has a price on their heads
The moment for holding on has passed
There is no rewind, no second chances

And I still can't carry the weight of the world
Take it off my back, take it off my back
The world it ends with you The world well it ends, the world well it ends with you
