You don't have to promise every morning
Through the mirror
I can see the sadness in your smile
Behind the broken frame

Let the shine reveal endless lies
Come down. Let the truth be shared
Silent cries. How can you deny?

How much more of pain can you contain in
This hollow body
Something burns inside and spicy aroma
Is mending up my nerves

Hear me scream, it is not your fault
Deep down underneath, the spineless controls
Binded by the fear
One day you will be filling up the will and start make anew
What you showed this world

Let the shine reveal endless lies
Come down let the truth be shared
Silent cries. How can you deny?
One day you will be filling up the will and start make anew
What you showed this world
