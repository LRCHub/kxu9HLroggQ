I've always been alone
Huh?
I'm so lonely
Why can't you relax when you're with me?
Why don't you open up to me?
I-I just can't
I think the world ends with you
Baby please believe what I tell you is true
You're for me I know why I feel so new
Don't need the world I know that it ends with you
I think the world ends with you
Baby please believe what I tell you is true
You're for me I know why I feel so new
Don't need the world I know that it ends with you
Never seen a girl that looks like you
Never heard a word spoken more true
Tell me things you know won't make me blue
If we break my world will end with you
You make posts of yourself then delete them
You take pictures of yourself I should keep them
You make posts of yourself then delete them
You take pictures of yourself I should keep them
You make posts of yourself then delete them
You take pictures of yourself I should keep them
I think the world ends with you
Baby please believe what I tell you is true
You're for me I know why I feel so new
Don't need the world I know that it ends with you
I think the world ends with you
Baby please believe what I tell you is true
You're for me I know why I feel so new
Don't need the world I know that it ends with you
All I ever wanted was to share your dreams
I just wanted to find you by my side when I woke up
Is that asking too much?
It's the night, I'm scared of the night
It's got nothing to do with you
